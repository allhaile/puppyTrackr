# PuppyTrackr Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deployment to Vercel

### 1. Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

**Get these values from:**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → API
4. Copy the "Project URL" and "anon public" key

### 2. GitHub Setup (Private Repo Recommended)

```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: Enhanced PuppyTrackr with mood, energy, and comprehensive tracking"

# Create GitHub repo (replace 'your-username' with your GitHub username)
# Go to GitHub.com → New Repository → Make it PRIVATE → Don't initialize with README
```

### 3. Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add your GitHub repo as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/puppytrackr-react.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Deploy with Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository (Vercel will ask for GitHub access)
4. **IMPORTANT:** Add environment variables in Vercel:
   - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` with your Supabase URL
   - Add `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with your Supabase anon key
